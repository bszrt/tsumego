<p>This is a first attempt at a tsumego generator I'm working on. A lot of functionality is still missing, but this is a good indication of the kind of thing I want to do. Since it's randomly generated, you might have to try a few times before you get a good one. Also since it's randomly generated, there's no solutions.</p>

<p>All problems are "what is the state of this corner" problems. Can B live? Can W kill? Click the button to generate a new one:</p>
